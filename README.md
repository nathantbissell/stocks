This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

buttons were created using www.bestcssbuttongenerator.com. Progress bars were implemented from React Bootstrap (documentation: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/progress/) all the rest of the code built from scratch.

this single page application simulates the daily life of your average stock broker. A user will start the game with 100 dollars and attempt to make 2,000. In order to make more money, the user must buy and sell stock using the buttons on the screen. If the player runs out of money or the stock value hits 0, the game is over!

Future game modes will allow
-multiple stocks
-different in game achievements
-backend server that logs all user stats
-more interactive icons and realistic stock prices
-graphs indicating price dynamically
